# Getting started
There are two fundamental categories for digital document writing. The first is plain text, where formatting is done through code. The second are word processors, documents that hide most to all of the formatting away from the user such that they experience an interface known as WYSIWYG (what you see is that you get), where bolded words are literally bolded on your document.

LaTeX  is one of the more sophisticated types of document writing, plain text using markup tagging to define general structure and code for the document. For example, `\textbf{XYZ}` means to bold *XYZ*. What
makes LaTeX  an attractive platform for document writing is control and consistency. We will see the power of LaTeX eX as we go further in this README, and hopefully show you the benefits of learning such a powerful word editing tool.

## Setting it up
There are two pieces to setting up LaTeX on your local computer
* A LaTeX  compiler (for either Windows or Mac). This takes what you write, and converts it into a clean and professional document.
* Optional, although highly recommended, a LaTeX  IDE (integrated development environment) where you can type and compile your code in one software enviornment (much like using Word).

## Downloads
* LaTeX  compiler
	- PC: [MikTex](https://miktex.org/download)
	- Mac: [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)
* LaTeX  IDE (in order of _my_ preference)
	- [TeXmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
	- [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)
	- [TeXworks](http://www.tug.org/texworks/) (this is automatically installed with most TeX compiler installations)

To avoid a long step-by-step guide on downloading these packages, I will instead refer you to easy to follow online videos, courtesy rof YouTube.

# Things to know (in general) before diving in
Here are some pointers about, well, computers in general before you get too lost into the world of LaTeX. If you are a computer savant, please go ahead and skip this; but if you are one who needs a mouse to click through your computer and feels lost otherwise, then please read on.

The first are paths. Typically all operating systems will have a GUI that lets you click through folders to access other folders or files. Much like the PC file explorer below:
